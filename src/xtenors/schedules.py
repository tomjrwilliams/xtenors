# map coupon freq to num months

# iterate between effective and term date

# all dates from either first or last in range
# and bound with other

# fowrad vs backward



# then payments generated as 

# year_frac (= day_factor) between each pair of dates in schwedule
# payment = frac * notional * coupon

# optional payment lag from coupon date


# payments / flows can then be valued against a given discount curve
